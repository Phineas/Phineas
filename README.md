### Hey, I'm Phin 👋

I'm a 20 year old developer and founder.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working on [Hop](https://hop.io) - we're a cloud platform focusing on supporting real-time, high-bandwidth applications. With Hop Ignite, you can deploy _any_ app to Hop directly from GitHub and achieve global low-latency content delivery - it's super easy, and we'll automatically handle new builds and rollouts when you push to the main branch. :)

## ⚡️ Experience

I like to say that I'm full-stack, though I'm mostly experienced in real-time systems. I highly leverage [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) to build scalable realtime systems, and I pair that with React on the frontend. I've been working with React for about 5 years, Elixir for almost 4, and JavaScript for more than 6 years.
