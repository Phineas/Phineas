### Hey, I'm Phin 👋

I'm a 19 year old developer and founder.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working on [Giggl](https://giggl.app) - we're making it super easy for anyone to collaborate or watch anything online together using the concept of virtual cloud-hosted browsers.

## ⚡️ Experience

I like to say that I'm full-stack, but I'm very experienced in the real-time backend world. I highly leverage [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) to build scalable realtime systems, and I pair that with React on the frontend. I've been working with React for about 4 years, Elixir for almost 3, and JavaScript for more than 6 years.
